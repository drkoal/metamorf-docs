Metamorf is a Metadata Suite that generates SQL code within a framework based on select statements. Those queries are generated based on metadata that the user has entered on the framework. All this metadata is processed to maximize its potential, giving the user some features and facilities.

It can execute and materialize these datasets, control the lineage end to end, even deploy an api sharing all the metadata, all in one. Thanks to its development, it is easy to deploy and use for anyone.

It offers accelerators that allow you to develop data models in a faster and more controlled way, for example *Datavault* modelling. It offers, based on templates, the creation of entities in a standarized and scalable way, avoiding the possibility of human error.

This entire frameworks was created and is maintained by **Guillermo Aumatell Salom** *(guillermoaumatell@gmail.com)*. It is currently in beta phase constantly growing.

    Current Version: 0.4.4.2
